DAY 2 ### REGISTRY ###
regedit.exe , Located at C:\Windows\regedit.exe

get-item

SETHC.exe is a sticky key registry, you can establish persistance on it

New-PSDeive -Name HKU -PSProvider Registry -Root HKEY_USERS

Forensically Relevant keys 
-Internet URL history
-USB History
-Wireless accept point history
research anytime during baseline registry (Cont. on slides)

HKLM\BCD00000000
HKLM\SAM\SAM\

Baselining is comparing the customers Registry with a normal registry

HKLM has configurations for entire computer

HKCU resides in memory, will wipe after reset 

connecting by remote registry id det to deufakt si yiu can't do that

reg query hklm\software\microsoft\windows\currentversion\run

reg add hklm\software\microsoft\windows\currentversion\run /v testkey /t REG_SZ /d C:\Windows\system32\WindowsPowershell\v1.0\powershell.exe

reg delete hklm\software\microsoft\windows\currentversion\run /v testkey

 get-childitem get-itemproperty get-item ### to query registries

set-itemproperty remove-itemproperty ### to append items in key and delete item in key

new-item new-itemproperty ### 

 get-childitem HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\ ### Shows sub-keys but not values

get-item HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\ Shows values but not sub-keys 

Day 3 ### LINUX ###

which ### shows path of commands 
hostname ### shows name of the host on computer, shows which BOX you're on
whoami ### who is logged in right now 
who ### shows who is all logged in on the machine 
ifconfig or ip config ###displays network interfaces and configured IP addresses 
arp or ip neigh ### see MAC Addresses on machines 
ip route or route ### Shows where packets are being routed to 
ss or netstat ### will show network connections or listening ports 
     -netstat -anop ### shows all network connections and executables with them
iptable ### shows firewall rules (you need admin permissions)
sudo !! ### runs previous commands with admin permissions
sudo -l ### shows what command a user can run with elevated permissions 
whereis ### locates binary, source and manual page files for the command that follows


Arguments ### Modify the functionallity of the base command to get desired results 
ls (--help) ### is an argument for a command to help the user understand command 

Variables and Command Substitution
echo $a ### trying to echo the variable a
directories=$(ls -lisa) ### the directories variable does an ls with -lisa options

Redirection
StandardInput = 0
StandardOutput = 1 
StandardError = 2 
Redirection is done with >(filename or numbered stream)
EX: ls coffee 2> error.txt

Piping 
standard output to standard input 

Automation 
For loops  
goes through items in a list until doesn't meet condition
If
Runs Statement until no longer true then goes to an else block
While
Execute statement until it is false 
will run infinitely

Linux Filesystems
/root 
/bin ### essential User commands
/sbin ### used for system maintance
/home ###
/etc ### SystemCofigs
/var ### Variable data
/boot ### everything pertaining to the proccess execpt config files 
/dev ### device files 
/lib ### kernel modules and shared libaries
/mnt ### generic points for mount devices 
/proc ### processes
obt/ ### softwate and packages from 
file ### shows you what type of file it is 

Linux Users
id ### shows uid,gid,groups
cat /etc/passwd | grep student ### gets the same as id
cat /etc/group | grep student ### shows the sudo group, gid values, members 
ls -lisa /bin/dd ### shows privileges for files with read, write, execute 
sticky bit ### removes the ability to delete files unless the user attempting is th owner of the file 
Special Permissions SUID and GUID allows only for the owning user or group to access the executable 

Day 4 

BIOS and UEFI Proccess is the same just different variations 
BIOS
-uses bootmgr
-OS Loader uses winload.exe or winresume.exe
UEFI
-uses bootmgrfw.efi
-OS Loader winload.efi or winresume.efi
Windows Pre-Boot and Boot Process 
POST -> BIOS or UEFI -> MBR or GUID Partition Table -> go to FG Study Guide for more info
System has the PID of 4
Windows 10 logon process -> FG Study Guide for more info
BCDEDIT allows for user to edit BOOT Configuration
Firmware is the middleground between Boot process and system, is non-voliatile 
HAL is a layer between kernel and Hardware 
bcdedit /export C:\Lion_BCD grabs backup of bcdedit and puts it into C Drive 
bcdedit /set {current} 
bcdedit /create {ntldr} /d "Windows" 
bcdedit /display
bcdedit /deletevalue 
bcdedit /import
bcdedit /delete

Going to bad previous config
Windows Initalizing services 
System reverting to bad conf
