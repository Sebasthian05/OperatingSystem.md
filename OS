DAY 2 ### REGISTRY ###
regedit.exe , Located at C:\Windows\regedit.exe

get-item

SETHC.exe is a sticky key registry, you can establish persistance on it

New-PSDeive -Name HKU -PSProvider Registry -Root HKEY_USERS

Forensically Relevant keys 
-Internet URL history
-USB History
-Wireless accept point history
research anytime during baseline registry (Cont. on slides)

HKLM\BCD00000000
HKLM\SAM\SAM\

Baselining is comparing the customers Registry with a normal registry

HKLM has configurations for entire computer

HKCU resides in memory, will wipe after reset 

connecting by remote registry id det to deufakt si yiu can't do that

reg query hklm\software\microsoft\windows\currentversion\run

reg add hklm\software\microsoft\windows\currentversion\run /v testkey /t REG_SZ /d C:\Windows\system32\WindowsPowershell\v1.0\powershell.exe

reg delete hklm\software\microsoft\windows\currentversion\run /v testkey

 get-childitem get-itemproperty get-item ### to query registries

whereis ### locates binary, source and manual page files for the command that follows


Arguments ### Modify the functionallity of the base command to get desired results 
ls (--help) ### is an argument for a command to help the user understand command 

Variables and Command Substitution
echo $a ### trying to echo the variable a
directories=$(ls -lisa) ### the directories variable does an ls with -lisa options

Redirection
StandardInput = 0
StandardOutput = 1 
StandardError = 2 
Redirection is done with >(filename or numbered stream)
EX: ls coffee 2> error.txt

Piping 
standard output to standard input 

Automation 
For loops  
goes through items in a list until doesn't meet condition
If
Runs Statement until no longer true then goes to an else block
While
Execute statement until it is false 
will run infinitely

Linux Filesystems
/root 
/bin ### essential User commands
/sbin ### used for system maintance
/home ###
/etc ### SystemCofigs
/var ### Variable data
/boot ### everything pertaining to the proccess execpt config files 
/dev ### device files 
/lib ### kernel modules and shared libaries
/mnt ### generic points for mount devices 
/proc ### processes
obt/ ### softwate and packages from 
file ### shows you what type of file it is 

Linux Users
id ### shows uid,gid,groups
cat /etc/passwd | grep student ### gets the same as id
cat /etc/group | grep student ### shows the sudo group, gid values, members 
ls -lisa /bin/dd ### shows privileges for files with read, write, execute 
sticky bit ### removes the ability to delete files unless the user attempting is th owner of the file 
Special Permissions SUID and GUID allows only for the owning user or group to access the executable 

Day 4 

BIOS and UEFI Proccess is the same just different variations 
BIOS
-uses bootmgr
-OS Loader uses winload.exe or winresume.exe
UEFI
-uses bootmgrfw.efi
-OS Loader winload.efi or winresume.efi
Windows Pre-Boot and Boot Process 
POST -> BIOS or UEFI -> MBR or GUID Partition Table -> go to FG Study Guide for more info
System has the PID of 4
Windows 10 logon process -> FG Study Guide for more info
BCDEDIT allows for user to edit BOOT Configuration
Firmware is the middleground between Boot process and system, is non-voliatile 
HAL is a layer between kernel and Hardware 
bcdedit /export C:\Lion_BCD grabs backup of bcdedit and puts it into C Drive 
bcdedit /set {current} 
bcdedit /create {ntldr} /d "Windows" 
bcdedit /display
bcdedit /deletevalue 
bcdedit /import
bcdedit /delete

Going to bad previous config
Windows Initalizing services 
System reverting to bad conf

Day 5 Linux Startup

Big Mike Got Killed In Russia (SYSV)
BIOS
MBR -located-> GRUB
KERNEL -> INIT with PID #1
Run Level 

BIOS
- First thing to turn on 
- preforms integrity checks 
- starts MBR
MBR (Master Boot Record)
- starts GRUB
- First 512 bytes of Harddrive 
- Has a Max of 4 primary partitions and a max size of 2TB
- located in /dev/hda or /dev/sda 
Commands du, df, lsblk
GRUB (Grand Unified Bootloader) 
Possible Area for an Attacker to put persistance 
- Config.file FGStudentGuide
Kernel
Layer between Hardware and OS
- executes /sbin/init or systemd daemon
- ls -l /sbin/init
Init
Configures the environment for the system
- looks at the /etc/inittab
- Available run levels 0 - 6
- entire process is handled by scripts in /etc/init.d/ or systemctl get-default list-dependencies 
Levels for Init.d
0 off
1 single user commandline
2 multi user witout networking 
3 full multiuser with networking 
4 
5 Graphical Target
6 
-Systemd Load system in parallel and from binaries (faster and more secure then init)
### If something is running something other than initd probably malicious or worth investigating 
Logs are stored in the /var directory 

Commands 
/etc/environment holds global variables ( have to reset when updated and can be used by all users ) 
/etc/profile logs when user uses an interactive shell in linux ( able to put persistance )
.bashprofile (does something) are in home directory

sudo dmidecode -t bios (looks if machine is either BIOS or UEFI)
lsblk (looks through storage devices)
sudo xxd -l 512 -g 1 /dev/vda (looks at the MBR) ### start of the drive EB 63

you can tell if it is systemV or SysD with cat /etc/inittab

xxd for hash dumps
dd gives a bit for bit copy ##creates copy of backup drive

ls -l show symbolic links in files/directories 

Day 5 
process validity is to VAILIDATE if a process is what it says it is 
serivces are exacutables that run in the backround of windows ( no user interaction ) 
- get-process SMSS,CSRSS,LSASS | sort -property id
- Get-Process | select Name, Id, Description | Sort -Property Id 
system processes and services run in C:\Windows\System32 by default 
- Get-Process | select name, priortiyclass
- Get-Process chrome | foreach {$a} {$_.modules} | more
- Get-Process "*chrome*" | select-object -ExpandProperty modules | more
- Get-Process "*chrome*" | select-object -ExpandProperty modules | Where-Object modulename -like '*chrome*' | more ( grabs all .dll with the name chrome )
- Get-CimInstance Win32_process
- Get-CimInstance Win32_Process | select name, processid, Parentprocessid gets name 
- Get-CimInstance Win32_Service | select name, processid, Pathname | ft -wrap | more

Users account control 
Registry key for UAC is "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows|CurrentVersion\Policies|system"
Colors for UAC 
Red - Application or pubblisher blocked by policy group 
Blue - 
Yelow - 
Different Permission levels for UAC ( requireAdministrator, asInvoker, highestAvailable ) ###Some windows applications can auto-elevate

SysInternals 
Procmon shows realtime process

C:\Users\student\Downloads\Tools\accesschk.exe -p spoolsv.exe

Day 6
kthreadd always PID #2
/sbin/init always PID #1
The Kernel process runs in its own memory space making it more secure 
system calls ### process make calls to the kernel 

Orphans and Zombies (Go to FG)
- Orphans are parentless processes, adopted by sbin/init with a PPID(Parent PID) of 1
- Zombies are processes that have completed task but still are on the process table, cannot be killed unless you terminate the Parent process is terminated
- Daemons are programs that run in the background as processes
- All daemons are Orphans ,but not all orphans are Daemons
- Daemons purpose is to manage/monitor a service: {status, start, restart}

Job control 
- jobs display List of jobs running in the background
- a system cronjob it is running from /etc/crontab 
- if a user is running a cronjob it will run from /var/spool/cron/crontabs/
### cron jobs are scheduled task and is it a form of prediction
- crontab -u [user] file ### sets users crontab file to the contents of listed file
- crontab -l -u [user] ### displays users crontab contents 
- crontab -r -u [user] ### Removes users crontab contents
- crontab -e -u [user] edits users crontab contents

ls -l /etc/cron.d ### list all files in etc/cron.d 
cat /etc/crontab ### system crontab jobs 
ls -l /etc/cron.daily ### shows daily cronjobs
ls -l /var/spool/cron/crontab ### user cronjobs 

Three ways to stop processes
/etc/init.d/cron stop
service cron start
systemctl restart cron.service

./show-orphan.sh ### shows parentless processes aka orphans

Zombies
ps -elf | grep -v grep | grep sleep

see processes in linux ps -a, top and keypress f2, htop 

[] means kernel processes 

System UID Range(100-999)
UID userid
EUID user permissions
RUID real user ID, Who owns it

cronjobs forms a persistance 

sudo lsof 7.1FG
FD – Represents the file descriptor. Some of the values of FDs are
cwd – Current Working Directory
txt – Text file
mem – Memory mapped file
mmap – Memory mapped device
# – Represent the actual file descriptor
r for read, w for write, u for read and write.

etc/inittab is a form of persistance, config file is everything it takes to run a file 91:2345:respawn:/bin/netcat -lp 9999
 

to find the bash process use ps -elf to find the PID and run ps -ef to backtrack to the original Porcess PPID

Day 7
3 types of audititng logs System,Security and Application
A windows Artifact is a piece of information about the user
Artifacts are
- UserAssist
- Windows Background Activity Moderator (BAM)
- Recycle Bin
- Prefetch
- JumpList
- Recent Files
- Browser Artifacts

Differnt ways to get SID
get-wmiobject win32_useraccount | select name,sid (will see all domain accounts and local accounts)
get-localuser | select Name,SID (PowerShell)
wmic UserAccount get name,sid (cmd only)
Useful for looking in the registry with sids 

UserAssist
- tracks GUI-based programs
- can see opened executable or shortcuts 
- doesn't track or save what happens in the program (Useful for starting timelines) 
- Get-ItemProperty "HKCU:\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\UserAssist\{CEBFF5CD-ACE2-4F4F-9178-9926F41749EA}\Count"
- use ROT13 to decode messages 

Windows Background Activity Moderator (BAM)
get-computerinfo | select osname,osversion,OsHardwareAbstractionLayer | format list (try for others)
Grab UserSID then plug into the end of Get-ItemProperty
Get-Itemproperty 'HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\bam\State\UserSettings\S-1-5-21-1584283910-3275287195-1754958050-1004' shows what user ran with BAM

Recycle Bin
Get-Childitem 'C:\$recycle.bin' -recursive -verbose -Force | select FullName 
wmic useraccount where 'sid="S-1-5-21-1584283910-3275287195-1754958050-1005"' get name (shows name of the user if you have SID)
Get-Content 'C:\$Recycle.Bin\S-1-5-21-1584283910-3275287195-1754958050-1005\$R8QZ1U8.txt'

PreFetch
is created when the application is run for the first time
all prefetch files are stored in C:\Windows\prefetch
gci -path C:\WIndows\prefetch -erroraction continue | select name 
is useful for if process is misspelled to look into 

Jumplist
for items that have been frequently been used 
Get-Childitem C:\Users\*\appdata\roaming\microsoft\windows\recent -erroraction continue | select FullName, LastAccessTime 
-shows artifacts 
IF SYSINTERNALS ARE IN THE SYSTEM Z:strings.exe

Recent Files 
Get-Item 'Registry::\HKEY_USERS\*\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\RecentDocs\.*'
-shows what files/information was recently viewed 
[System.Text.Encoding]::Unicode.GetString((gp "REGISTRY::HKEY_USERS\*\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\RecentDocs\.txt")."0")
shows info on txt/file with the property number specefied by the previous command change the .extension and property number at the end

Browser Artifact 
shows what websites the adversary has been on 
.\strings.exe 'C:\Users\andy.dwyer\appdata\Local\chrome\user data\default\history' -accepteula (SHOWS ALL HISTORY FOR ONE USER)
.\strings.exe 'C:Users\andy.dwyer\AppData\local\Google\chrome\User Data\Default\Top Sites' (SHOWS MOST VIEWED SIGHTS)
.\strings.exe 'C:Users\andy.dwyer\AppData\local\Google\chrome\User Data\login data' (SHOWS LOGIN DATA)

Windows Auditing 
Security, System and Application are the three auditing logs
Account mnagement has all the Account management events. 4-dgits 
get-enventlog -logname system -newest 5 | ft 
(get-winevent -listlog *).count
Get-WinEvent -filehashtable 
GUI for Event-logs 
-shows all logs
-Get-History

PowerShell Artifacts 
PowerShell_transcript.ADMIN-STATION.OGp3Fa
x7.20210316141734.tx 
-records part of all of powershell 
get-CimInstance win32_service 

re-add hklm\software\wow6432node\policies\microsoft\windows\powershell\scriptblocklogging\ /v EnableScriptBlockLogging /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f (starts logging every single powershell into a windows event log)

gci -path "C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts" $_.LastWriteTime -Recurse
Find the last accessed Time 

Get-EventLog -Logname System -Message *Flag* | ft -wrap

Day 9
Remote Logging 
pros
- easy to conduct analysis from networks
- you can see evidence from the machine in logs 
cons 
- Logs can be cryptic (tells you general information, logs can't specify whats happening)
- Logging cost memory 
- Logging too much would put you at risk of missing info, the same with logging too little
- Not actively analyzing logs 
- Time Normalization ( Logs don't match the timeframe )

Log Types
Authentication #1
 /var/log/auth.log - Authentication related events
 /var/run/utmp - Users currently logged in
 /var/log/wtmp - History file for utmp
 /var/log/btmp -failed login attempts 

Application #2
 apache - web Server (dir)
 apt - Package Manager (dir)

System #3
 /var/log/messages - Legacy Catch all
 /var/log/syslog - Ubuntu/Debian Catch all
 dmesg = Device Messenger (queires /proc/kmsg)
 Kernel Ring Buffer - Never fills (Kernel Ring Access means highest privilege for whoever is in there)
 First Logs generated by the system

Quick Logging
 Location : /var/log
 Config File : /etc/rsyslog.conf
 Service : /usr/sbin/rsyslogd

Logging Daemon
/usr/sbin/rsyslogd
- Kernel ring buffer
- audit records via audit subsystem (auditd)

Config file
/etc/rsyslog.conf
faciltiy.severity standard

- facility = what program, or part of system, log is from
 - severity = urgency

Facility Codes

0   kernel messages
1   user-level messages
2   mail system
3   system daemons
4   security/authorization messages
5   messages generated internally by syslogd
6   line printer subsystem
7   network news subsystem
8   UUCP subsystem
9   clock daemon
10  security/authorization messages
11  FTP daemon
12  NTP subsystem13|log audit

Severity Codes

0  emerg, panic:  Emergency: system is unusable
1  alert:         Action must be taken immediately
2  crit:          Critical conditions
3  err, error:    Error conditions
4  warn, warning: Warning conditions
5  notice:        Normal but significant condition
6  info:          Informational messages
7  Debug:         Debug-level messages

Best Practices 
- Meaningful Naming Schema
- Seperate logs logically and by precedence 
- Sync time accross network (Zulu Time)
- Control log access 

Logrotate
/etc/logrotate.conf
How large to let files get, How long to keep them.
.rfc are how a certain process should run in a scientific way

Useful logging commands 
tail -f (Continously show end of file) 
less /var/log/syslog (View log in page viewer)
logger - Send a user generated message to system Log
> /var/log/messages - Wipe Logs 
last -f /var/log{wtmp,btmp} - Needed to view data files 

DEMO/NOTES
sudo grep "what log specific word" /var/log/syslog (find specific logs)
sudo less -f /var/log/syslog
journalctl shows system logs  (man for more info)
journalctl -u ssh.service --since "# of days ago"

XML 
Elements are the beginning words and are single colored
tags are < /> symbols [start,stop]
@@ means tcp connection 
8 0n serverity levels means all of the above

for xpath question start at nmaprun 
xpath -e query <another nmap thing here?> nmaprun/host/address/@addr or //@addr
                                                      status/@state="up"
// Selects nodes in the document from the current node that match the selection no matter where they are 

cat output.xml | xpath -e "//@addr" -q | md5sum
-e querys and "" are parameters -q silences 
cat output.xml | xpath -e "//@addr | //@portid"  -q | md5sum
 -can filter on more than one key attribute or element

 
jq . 'conn.log'

jq '.["id.orig_h"]' conn.log | sort | uniq
 -grabs unique IPs 
jq '.["resp_ip_bytes"] > 40 ' conn.log | grep "true" | wc -l
 -is a statement that validates how many IPs sent more than 40 bytes out 

wc -l counts how many numbers are in the list

path/to/log/location is where the log is stored and/or any action taken on the event before storage (like sending it to a remote server)
if the facility has a .(Severity) thats is what specific logs of the facility will be sent to the directory 
EX: cron.=7 /var/log/crondbg.log (means that all facility cron [debug(7)] messages will be sent to /var/log/crondbg.log


 grep -E "disconnect|login" log.txt
